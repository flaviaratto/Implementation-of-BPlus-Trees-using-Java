# Implementation-of-BPlus-Trees-using-Java

Implemented B+ Trees in which the order of the tree is the parameter given by the user. Using randomly generated data, the algorithm creates a dense and sparse tree for the order provided. The B+ tree can perform various operations like - 

1. Search
2. Range Search
3. Insertion
4. Deletion

## Steps to run the application - ##

 1. The application is compiled using JDK7. Please ensure you have **JDK 7 or higher** installed. You need Java to run the application. Install according to your system if it is not already installed.  
  https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
  
 2. Double click on Project2_Part1_Final.jar file present in the ExecutableFile --> dist folder to run the appication

     If double clicking does not work, you can run the program in command line by typing in the command -
      ```
     java -jar "Project2_Part1_Final.jar"
      ```

     Please make sure you are in the directory where the .jar file is located while running the command.
     If both the above methods don't work, make sure the environment variables have been set correctly for Java


**Output** --> In the folder where the jar file is located, 4 output files will be generated storing results for each of the 4 trees we are required to create and perform experiments on.  
Output_Dense_13  
Output_Dense_24  
Output_Sparse_13  
Output_Sparse_24  

**Note:** If you want to view the source code and run that in NetBeans, the source code is present in the src folder 
MainClass.java is the main file
